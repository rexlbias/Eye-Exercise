Eyes
Exercise on eyes


This exercise with MIT Professional Certification course in Full-Stack Engineering with MERN, creates 2 eyes that follow the movement of your mouse on the screen.

How to Run
Load the index.html file. Notice the eyes follow your mouse as it moves across the screen. Future improvements would include adding interactive features to the page, such as blinks on click.

Future improvements would be making the eyes blink one at a time or both at same time.
